Introduction
============

PyFilesystem3 is a Python module that provides a common interface to any
filesystem.

Think of PyFilesystem3 ``FS`` objects as the next logical step to
Python's ``file`` objects. In the same way that file objects abstract a
single file, FS objects abstract an entire filesystem.


Installing
----------

You can install PyFilesystem3 with ``pip`` as follows::

    pip3 install fs3

Or to upgrade to the most recent version::

    pip3 install fs3 --upgrade

PyFilesystem3 is also available on conda_::

    conda install fs3 -c conda-forge

Alternatively, if you would like to install from source, you can check
out `the code from Github <https://github.com/jevinskie/pyfilesystem3>`_.
